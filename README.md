## A functions library written in C

![books (1)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/74e4085e-b735-40e8-bdbb-0e4973e51e9f)

It contains a lot of general purpose functions that our following programs will rely upon.
This was our first project in **Hive Helsinki**.
There isn't much visuals to show, because it is just a library.

You can find the subject [here](https://github.com/kenlies/42libft/blob/main/en.subject.pdf).
It gives an overview and contains the exact requirements for this project.

I actually completed this task in late **2022**, but I wanted to redo the commit history and make some minor changes.

## Getting started

If you want, for whatever reason, you can create the library file by:

  1. Clone the repository
  2. Cd into it
  3. ```make``` or ```make bonus``` for the bonus section

## Bonus section (optional)

The bonus part dove into the realm of linked lists, and how to create, delete, traverse and manipulate them.
This section was definitely worth doing. I think this helped me a lot throughout studies.
